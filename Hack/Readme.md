# Hacks to install torch2caffe

After looking at many permutations, I was able to install it although it didn't worked as layers are not supported, also it was returning a **nil** layer after processing some layers

**links.txt** contains some links of bug descriptions and some hacks needed to install it

[This repo](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/fb-caffe-exts) discusses the possible errors and gives a way to work around. Unfortunately this is also now deprecated so it doesn't work.
